# Performance Analysis – Decision Support

This repository contains a retail-based performance analysis case study designed to demonstrate **transferable decision-support analytics skills** applicable to public sector contexts, including roles such as **Performance Analyst embedded in digital delivery**.

The focus is on:
- defining meaningful performance metrics,
- validating and governing data quality,
- analysing drivers of performance,
- and producing actionable recommendations with clear measurement plans.

The work is deliberately **not data-science-led**; instead, it reflects how analysts support operational and strategic decisions in real organisational settings.

## Transferability to public sector performance analysis

The same analytical principles apply across domains:

- Retail category performance → Public sector service performance  
- Customers → Service users  
- Sales uplift → Throughput / timeliness improvement  
- Promotions → Policy or process interventions  

This repository demonstrates **methodological consistency**, with domain-specific context layered on top.
